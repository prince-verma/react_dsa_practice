## 🧠 What Is Domain-Driven Architecture (DDA)?

> **Domain-Driven Architecture** organizes your codebase around meaningful **business domains**, not technical categories. It reflects how your organization is structured—like `demand`, `edge`, and `seller`—with complete ownership per domain.

### 🔍 Key Principles
- 🧭 **Bounded Contexts**: Each domain is a self-contained unit with its own data, behavior, and logic
- 🗣️ **Ubiquitous Language**: Naming matches the business (e.g. “HousingPremium,” “ListingSeeker”)
- 🧱 **Autonomy**: Each domain is fully encapsulated, with clear contracts to communicate with others
- 🧪 **Testability**: Core logic is isolated and easily testable—no tangled dependencies

## ✅ When to Use DDA in React Native

Use Domain-Driven Architecture when:
- You have **multiple feature teams or PODs**, each owning a business capability
- Features like `HousingPremium` or `Payments` exist in multiple domains with distinct logic
- You need **clear separation** between modules to support scaling, onboarding, and fast iteration
- Your business logic is **complex**, domain-driven, and not just UI-deep
- You're planning for long-term maintainability, refactoring, and cross-platform reuse

## 🔁 Sample Redux Flow in DDA

```plaintext
[demand/presentation/screens/ListingsScreen.tsx]
   ↓
Dispatch → [demand/presentation/redux/demandThunks.ts]
   ↓
Thunk → [demand/application/useCases/matchListings.ts]
   ↓
UseCase → [demand/domain/interfaces/IDemandRepo.ts]
   ↓
Repository → [demand/infrastructure/repositories/ApiDemandRepo.ts]
   ↓
Data mapped to → [demand/domain/entities/Listing.ts]
   ↓
Returns domain model → updates Redux state
```

🔥 Each step lives inside the **demand context**—no leaking or cross-domain dependencies.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

> _With DDA, you’re not just organizing code—you’re modeling your business’s logic, language, and behavior._  
> _And when you wrap that in Clean layering, Redux orchestration, and atomic UI, you build apps that scale like platforms._
